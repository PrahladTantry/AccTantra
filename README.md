---Introduction---
Welcome to the accTantra Keymap repository, a thoughtfully designed typing standard for the Tulu language using an ASCII-based font. This project aims to simplify and standardize the process of typing Tulu on devices that may not natively support the script, making it accessible to a wider audience.

The word accTantra is made of 2 words. Accu means to impress(as in to physicially press, or print), and Tantra means "text, theory, system, method, instrument, technique or practice". The word AccTantra intends to mean 
"The Doctrine of Printing". The purpose of this standard is to unify the several ASCII Tulu fonts that are in circulation and that would be made in future, so that the common text remains compatible irrespective to what the font being used on top of it is.

Tulu, a Dravidian language rich in history and culture, deserves a robust digital presence. However, due to the lack of widespread support for native Tulu fonts, typing in Tulu can be a challenge. The accTantra Keymap bridges this gap by providing an easy-to-use, intuitive mapping of Tulu characters to standard ASCII keys.

Key Features
->  ASCII-Compatible: Leverages standard ASCII characters for maximum compatibility.
->  Intuitive Layout: Designed to be easy to learn and use, with logical mappings for Tulu characters.
->  Open and Extensible: Community contributions are welcome to enhance and refine the standard.
Whether you're creating Tulu documents, working on digital archives, or simply exploring the language, the accTantry Keymap empowers you to type effortlessly in Tulu.

Let’s preserve and celebrate the Tulu language in the digital age—one keystroke at a time.

---Purpose---
The primary purpose of the Tantry Keymap is to provide a standardized, user-friendly typing layout for the Tulu language using ASCII characters. This initiative addresses the challenges faced by Tulu speakers and enthusiasts in typing their language on digital platforms that lack native Tulu script support.

Goals
->  Promote the Use of Tulu Online: Empower users to create and share content in Tulu across websites, social media, and other digital platforms.
->  Bridge Compatibility Gaps: Offer a typing solution that works seamlessly with ASCII-based systems, ensuring broader accessibility without the need for specialized software.
->  Preserve Linguistic Heritage: Support the documentation, study, and revitalization of the Tulu language in the digital era.
->  Enable Cultural Expression: Provide tools for Tulu speakers to express their culture, literature, and traditions in their native script.
->  Ensure Font Independence: By adhering to a standardized ASCII-based layout, the underlying Latin text remains independent of the font being used. This ensures compatibility and portability, allowing the same text to be rendered       correctly regardless of the font or platform.
This project aspires to contribute to the linguistic diversity of the internet by making Tulu typing simple and effective for everyone, from casual users to professional linguists.

---Overview---

Here’s a draft for the Key Map Overview section:

Key Map Overview
The accTantra Keymap defines a systematic mapping of Tulu characters to ASCII keys, making it intuitive and easy to type in Tulu without requiring native script support. Each key is carefully chosen to align with phonetic or structural similarities to the corresponding Tulu character, ensuring a smooth learning curve for users familiar with the Latin alphabet.

Key Mapping Highlights
->  Phonetic Similarity: Keys are mapped based on the phonetic resemblance of Tulu letters to Latin characters.
->  Logical Modifiers: Long vowels, aspirated consonants, and other variations use logical extensions of the vowel signs, such as virama acting as a consonant placeholder to trigger aa vowel letter.
->  Numerals and Symbols: Common Tulu numerals and symbols are mapped to their ASCII equivalents.
->  For the complete key mapping, refer to the Full Key Map Documentation.

---Example of Usage---
-> (original text) Om namo Narayanaya
   (ascii text) EAamA nEma narayNay
